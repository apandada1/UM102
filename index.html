      <h1>MA 334: Introduction to Homotopy Type theory</h1>
      <div id="desc" class="section">
        <h3> Course Description </h3>
          <p> This course introduces homotopy type theory, which provides alternative foundations for mathematics based on deep connections between <strong>type theory</strong>, from logic  and computer science, and <stong>homotopy theory</strong>, from topology. This connection is based on interpreting <em>types</em> as <em>spaces</em>, <em>terms</em> as <em>points</em> and <em>equalities</em> as <em>paths</em>. Many homotopical notions have type-theoretic counterparts which are very useful for foundations.
          </p>

          <p>
             Such foundations are far closer to actual mathematics than the traditional ones based on set theory and logic, and are very well suited for use in computer-based proof systems, especially <em>formal verification systems</em>. We will use the <a href="http://leanprover.github.io/">Lean Theorem Prover</a> in this course. Note that the latest version (Lean 3) doen not support Homotopy Type Theory (yet), so you must use <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean2">Lean 2</a>.

        <h3> Prerequisites </h3>
          <p>Basic topology and mathematical maturity will be assumed. Some familiarity with algebraic topology will be  helpful, as will some familiarity with programming in a functional language.
          This course has a flavour very different from typical mathematics courses, so open-mindedness and willingness to learn alien concepts is essential.</p>

        <h3>Project</h3>
        The project for this course will be to formally prove a body of mathematics in Homotopy Type Theory in the Lean theorem prover. This will be judged on the basis of
        <ul>
          <li><em>Uniqueness:</em> Credit for implementing proofs not in the lean HoTT library, and not implemented by other students.</li>
          <li>Mathematical substance.</li>
          <li>Use of HoTT concepts.</li>
        </ul>
