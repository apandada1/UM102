### Optimization
* For functions of one variable, application of calculus.
* Have first derivative and second derivative test.
* In higher dimension:
  - to define first derivative: linear map (actually functional in this case).
  - second derivative : also captureb by a linear map - but a square symmetric matrix.
  - we can also have interesting constraints.
  - even more generally, we have _calculus of variations_.
  
### Linear Algebra
 * Study linear maps on vector spaces, because: 
   - many maps are linear
   - many functions are quadratic - these also can be expressed in linear algebra
   - smooth functions are locally approximately linear, with the second term quadratic.
    
 * By study, we typically mean properties or structures that do not change when we chang co-ordinates.
   - for a vector space, there is just one, the dimension.
   - for linear map, we consider different classes.
     - domain and co-domain equal (and change co-ordinates together).
     - co-domain real numbers (functionals).
     - more structure on vector spaces to be preserved - e.g. lengths and angles.
     - special classes of maps, e.g. symmetric matrices.
* One linear map can be described completely:
  - Sylvester's law of inertia
  - Jordan canonical form


### Local to global
 * Differential calculus lets us study local properties of functions.
 * To deduce from this global behaviour, we _integrate_ and _solve differential equations_.
